##React Tac Toe
This project started as the React tutorial released by facebook, and I decided to make it more interesting, both by doing the optional challenges, and changing the responsive behavior a lot.  I'm proud of how it turned out, and I put some love into both the behaviors and the appearance of this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
