##React Tac Toe##
This project started as the React tutorial released by Facebook, and I decided to make it more interesting. First I did the optional challenges, and had learned a lot. I also changed the responsive behavior, because I wasn't satisfied with how it looked on large monitors.  I'm proud of how it turned out, and I put some love into both the behaviors and the appearance of this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
