<h1>React Tac Toe</h1>

This project started as the React tutorial released by Facebook, and I decided to make it more interesting. 
First, I did the optional challenges, and I learned a lot. I had some interesting roadblocks with edge-case React behavior.
Then, I gave it some responsive behavior, because I wasn't satisfied with how it looked on large monitors.  I'm proud of how it turned out, and I put some work into both the behaviors and the appearance of this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
