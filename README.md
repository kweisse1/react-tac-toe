<h1>React Tac Toe</h1>

This project started as the React tutorial released by Facebook, and I decided to make it more interesting. <br>
First, I did the optional challenges, and I learned a lot. I had some interesting challenges with React behavior. I learned a lot about React by fixing errors I wasn't expecting. <br>
Then, I gave it some responsive behavior, because I wasn't satisfied with how it looked on large monitors. <br> 
I'm proud of how it turned out.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
